# tracker

A simple command line program to help keep track of work time.

Run `tracker start` to start working. It might look like this (I use `$` here to represent your shell prompt): 

```bash
$ tracker start
[monday 2024-01-08]
* 08:28-
```

As you later end your shift, run `tracker stop`. 

```bash
$ tracker stop
[monday 2024-01-08]
* 08:28-11:40
```
