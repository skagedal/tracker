# tracker

A simple command line program to help keep track of work time by storing data in a simple per-week text file. It is designed for the use case where you have flexible work hours, but wish to keep track that you work a certain number of hours per week â€“ by default 40, divided into five work days.

Run `tracker start` to start working. It might look like this (I use `$` here to represent your shell prompt): 

```
$ tracker start
[monday 2024-01-08]
* 08:28-
```

As you later end a shift, run `tracker stop`. 

```
$ tracker stop
[monday 2024-01-08]
* 08:28-11:40
```

Use `tracker report` to show your progress. 

```
$ tracker report
You have worked 3 h 12 m today.
You have worked 3 h 12 m this week.
Balance: -4 h 48 m
```

The balance tells you that you have 4 hours and 48 minutes left to work this day in order to be in balance. 

While the normal mode of operation is to use `tracker start` and `tracker stop` to track your shifts, you may find that you sometimes forget to start your shift, or otherwise make an error that you wish to correct. Instead of offering a specific user interface to do such edits, `tracker` lets you open the data file for the current week in your text editor of choice (following the `EDITOR` environment variable) by using `tracker edit`.

Here is an example of what a file might look like after two days of tracking: 

```
[monday 2024-01-08]
* 08:28-11:40
* 12:30-17:00

[tuesday 2024-01-09]
* 08:13-12:00
* 13:06-14:40
* 15:01-16:34
```

Each day starts with the week day and ISO-formatted date in square brackets. (The duplication in information is intentional, to make it easier to read the file.) Each shift is represented by a line starting with an asterisk, followed by the start and end time in 24-hour format, separated by a hyphen.

Comments can be written in the file using lines starting with `#`. 

## Transferring balance

Tracker will only look at the current week file when stating your report. If you wish to transfer a balance from a previous week, it can be done by adding a line like this to the top of the current week file: 

```
* balance 3h 12m
```

This will add 3 hours and 12 minutes to the balance for the current week.
